# Image-Captioning

Trying to learn different techniques of computer vision and NLP to recognize the context of an image and describe them.
The model involves image caption generator by using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long short term memory) units.
For training model, Flickr_8K dataset is used.

Here are the link to the datasets,
The image and corresponding captions dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/shadabhussain/flickr8k
For the glove model dataset (for pretrained word vectors): https://www.kaggle.com/incorpes/glove6b200d
